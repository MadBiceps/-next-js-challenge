/**
 * Write a function called palindrome that takes a string as an argument and returns true if the string is a palindrome,
 * and false otherwise. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward
 * as forward (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization).
 * 
 * For example, palindrome("racecar") should return true, palindrome("A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!") should return true,
 * and palindrome("hello world") should return false.
 * 
 * Your function should ignore any non-alphanumeric characters (such as spaces and punctuation) and should be case-insensitive.
