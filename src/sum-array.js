/**
 * Write a recursive function called sumArray that takes an array of numbers as an argument
 * and returns the sum of all the numbers in the array. Your function should use recursion,
 * and should not use any built-in array methods (such as reduce or forEach).
 *
 * For example, sumArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) should return 15 (which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5), and sumArray([10, 20, 30]) should return 60.
